Sounds of boxes and containers being opened followed, along with the handling and arranging of items. The faucet was turned on, with running water mixed with scrubbing sounds from cleaning dishes and rinsing vegetables, reflecting ongoing washing activities. A heavy pot or pan was placed down, followed by the continuous sound of plastic being torn open, interlaced with the clinking of glassware. Ingredients were repeatedly washed, poured into pots or bowls, and sometimes water was transferred from bowls to pots for soaking. Meanwhile, appliances were activated with occasional beeping or button clicks, and liquid seasonings were added into the pot. Objects were frequently handled, organized, and moved around. Soon after, a long sequence of unwrapping various packages unfolded, producing extended periods of plastic crinkling sounds. Then, several ingredients were chopped one after another on the cutting board, with occasional turning on and off of appliances such as an induction stove. Some of the chopped items were transferred into bowls for later use. The faucet was turned on multiple times to rinse produce, with actions like seasoning and stirring interwoven throughout the sequence."

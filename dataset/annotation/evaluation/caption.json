This is followed by washing or scrubbing some utensils to get ready for cooking. Then, the stove is ignited, and seasonings are added, with a counter wipe-down occurring in between. At this point, kitchen appliances start running. Next comes another round of chopping, after which the pan emits a continuous sizzling and frying sound, indicating that ingredients are being pan-cooked over high heat, accompanied by constant stirring. Throughout this stage, the counter is wiped and tidied multiple times. As cooking progresses, there’s another session of pan cooking, interspersed with more chopping. Then, eggs are cracked into a bowl and whisked, followed by intense rounds of pan frying, accompanied by audible stirring and scraping sounds. Across the entire process, stirring and counter wiping are repeatedly performed, with multiple rounds of pan cooking, interspersed with cleaning, dishwashing, and trash disposal. Cooking continues with another round of pan frying, followed by a counter wipe. After several more frying sessions, dishwashing is performed again, and a bowl is retrieved from a cabinet in preparation for the next step. Finally, the cooking workflow concludes with a steady pan-frying session and a final counter cleanup."
